# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

ðŸ‘‹ **Hello!** I'm on an exciting journey to become a Pentester in Cybersecurity. Over the past few years, I've been diving deep into the world of coding and researching the intricacies of how computers and networks function.

## What I'm Passionate About:
- **Cybersecurity**: My primary focus, with a keen interest in penetration testing.
- **Coding**: I code in Python as a kind of schematic before implementing in C or C++. I've also experimented with RUST, though I'm a bit rusty now as I've shifted focus to other low level programming languages.
- **Research**: From computer networking to web scraping basics, APIs, reverse engineering, and much more, Iâ€™m constantly learning and expanding my knowledge.

## My Projects:
On my GitHub, you can find personal projects that showcase my learning journey. These projects reflect my progress as I continue to hone my skills in cybersecurity and programming.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out if you share similar interests!

ðŸš€ **Let's connect and grow together in this exciting field!**
